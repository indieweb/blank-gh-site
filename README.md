# Web Dev Guy

Using this as my current one page site as I start learning Full Stack Web Development

## Current Goals (28FEB2020):

1. [ ] Learn more than just basic HTML5, as well as best formatting practices.
2. [ ]Get pretty good with CSS because it's cool.
3. [ ]Start learning Vanilla JS so I can make interactive pages.
4. [ ]Get a LOT better with Git because my first attempts were a shit show (Just don't read my commits for a while).
5. [ ]Use 1-3 to build a nice looking website.
6. [ ]Once nice looking website has been made, start learning React.js (Don't ask how I picked the framework because you'll be disappointed).
7. [ ]Build an even cooler website.
8. [ ]Re-learn about how the internet works (HTTP(S), DNS, GET/POST stuff, OSI vs TCP/IP models, etc).
9. [ ]Start learning Node.js for backend because I like the way it looks.
10. [ ]Make an even more cool website than the last two becuase it'll do backen things (I hope).

I think that's enough for now.
