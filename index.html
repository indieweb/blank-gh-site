        <p class="">
          Hi, my name is <span class="p-name">Gabe Corsini</span> and I am a human on the Internet. I am working to become a
          primarily self-taught Full Stack Web Developer, with the hopes of one day moving on from my current career and
          into the private sector Web Development space.

        <h3>A little bit about me.</h3>
          <p>
            Currently, I am an active duty servicemember in the US Military. I have been in the service since 2012 and work as an Information Systems Technician, which is just the fancy way of saying I'm a military IT guy. In recent months, I have began reaching the conclusion that I am ready to exit the service and pursue something different. I've always had a passion for software development and programming, but struggled to learn many full programming languages (e.g. Java, C++, C#, etc) since I do not have a traditional college education. Not long ago, I fell into the web development space at the recommendation of my twin brother and I've been really enjoying it. So here we are, on this journey to become a Full Stack Web Developer so that, by the end of 2022 when it's time to exit the service, I have the experience and the know how to go find a job that I want and do what I love.

        <p>
          Here are my current goals, in order, for what I want to learn on my Web Development Journey. As I complete items, I will mark the boxes and supply a date at the end of the line for when I believe I accomplished the goal. This is subjective of course.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>[ ] Learn more than just basic HTML5, as well as best formatting practices.</li>
          <li>[ ] Get pretty good with CSS because it's cool.</li>
          <li>[ ] Start learning Vanilla JS so I can make interactive pages.</li>
          <li>[ ] Get a LOT better with Git because my first attempts were a shit show (Just don't read my commits for a while).</li>
          <li>[ ] Use 1-3 to build a nice looking website.</li>
          <li>[ ] Once nice looking website has been made, start learning React.js (Don't ask how I picked the framework because you'll be disappointed).</li>
          <li>[ ] Build an even cooler website.</li>
          <li>[ ] Re-learn about how the internet works (HTTP(S), DNS, GET/POST stuff, OSI vs TCP/IP models, etc).</li>
          <li>[ ] Start learning Node.js for backend because I like the way it looks.</li>
          <li>[ ] Make an even more cool website than the last two becuase it'll do backend things (I hope).</li>
        </ol>
