    <h1>Welcome to Web Dev Guy</h1>
      <section class="h-card">
        <p>
          Hi, my name is <span class="p-name">Gabe Corsini</span> and I am a human on the Internet. I&rsquo;m working to become a
          primarily self&hyphen;taught Full Stack Web Developer, with the hopes of one day moving on from my current career and
          into the private sector Web Development space.
        </p>
      <section id="about">
        <h3>A little bit about me.</h3>
          <p>
            Currently, I am an active duty servicemember in the US Military. I have been in the service since 2012 and work as an Information Systems Technician, which is just the fancy way of saying I'm a military IT guy. In recent months, I have began reaching the conclusion that I am ready to exit the service and pursue something different. I've always had a passion for software development and programming, but struggled to learn many full programming languages &lpar;e.g. Java, C&plus;, C&num;, etc&rpar; since I do not have a traditional college education. Not long ago, I fell into the web development space at the recommendation of my twin brother and I've been really enjoying it. So here we are, on this journey to become a Full Stack Web Developer so that, by the end of 2022 when it's time to exit the service, I have the experience and the know how to go find a job that I want and do what I love.

      <section id="goals">
        <p>
          Here are my current goals, in order, for what I want to learn on my Web Development Journey. As I complete items, I will mark the boxes and supply a date at the end of the line for when I believe I accomplished the goal. This is subjective of course.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Learn more than just basic HTML5, as well as best formatting practices.</li>
          <li>Get pretty good with CSS because it's cool.</li>
          <li>Start learning Vanilla JS so I can make interactive pages.</li>
          <li>Get a LOT better with Git because my first attempts were a shit show (Just don't read my commits for a while).</li>
          <li>Use 1-3 to build a nice looking website.</li>
          <li>Once nice looking website has been made, start learning React.js (Don't ask how I picked the framework because you'll be disappointed).</li>
          <li>Build an even cooler website.</li>
          <li>Re-learn about how the internet works (HTTP(S), DNS, GET/POST stuff, OSI vs TCP/IP models, etc).</li>
          <li>Start learning Node.js for backend because I like the way it looks.</li>
          <li>Make an even more cool website than the last two becuase it'll do backend things (I hope).</li>
        </ul>

              <td>HTML 5</td>
              <td>I mean, it's the skeleton of the internet. Can't have a body without bones right? IMHO, a strong grasp of the basics allows for a firm foundation on which to build the rest.</td>

            <td>CSS 3</td>
            <td>The first step to a good looking and interactive webpage.I've been told that a week knowledge in this area can cause a lot of issues in an enterprise. I want my sites to look good and CSS has so many fun frameworks I want to try.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Javascript</td>
            <td>This is where interactivity really takes off. Plus, Vanilla Javascript is the foundation to all of the front and backend frameworks I want to try later one (Like Node, React, and eventually Vue and more)</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>React</td>
            <td>I honestly picked it because I like the way the logo looks and it's one of the most popular frameworks in the sector right now.</td>

            <td>Git</td>

          <tr>
            <td>Networking Concepts</td>
            <td>Once I start working on the backend, I want to dive back into my networking basics. HTTP, TCP/UDP, the TCP/IP model, DNS, and so on</td>

          <tr>
            <td>Node</td>
            <td>One of the most popular backend frameworks available and competes with things like Python, Java, and C#. It may not expand as well as the others, but I think it's a good place to start for me at least.</td>
